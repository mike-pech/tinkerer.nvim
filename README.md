# tinkerer.nvim

A nice NeoVim config I made throughout the year of using NeoVim as my IDE and tinkering around it.

Loosely based on [kickstart.nivm](https://github.com/nvim-lua/kickstart.nvim). A massive thanks to them for *kickstarting* my journey to this peculiar rabbit hole that NeoVim is!

## Features

* Gruvbox theme (my faviourite)
* Everything included in kickstart.nvim is here (perhaps)
* telescope.nvim (requires `fzf` and `ripgrep` for the best experience)
* Silicon.nvim for generating beautiful snapshots of your precious code 
    * Requires `silicon` binary and some configuration (Use \[S\]earch Live \[G\]rep `nvim-silicon` to get there :)
* DAP debugger
* Auto-format on save with your favourite LSP
